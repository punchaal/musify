# Musify App

A social media app that will allow users to share their musical tastes with their friends and colleagues using spotify's API.

## Motivation

Music is the heart and soul of anything we do.

I wanted to develop an app that would inspire people to share their musical tastes with their buddies. Although a lot of applications allow you to
do so natively there isn't a great application that would make it more streamlined to view each other's activites.
